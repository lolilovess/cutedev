# 🧶 CuteDev: THE STURDY-STITCH WORKSPACE 🍦
### "coding is just digital crochet. don't @ me."

hi!! 👋 i'm **loli**. if you're like me, you spend half your life in the code editor. the corporate dark modes and blinding white defaults were giving me pure despair, so i hijacked **github.dev** (VS Code Web) to match the ivory empire.

this repository contains the `settings.json` snippet with specific color tokens and CSS overrides to turn your dev environment into a warm, handmade notebook.

## 📜 1. THE WORKSPACE MANIFESTO
this isn't just a theme; it's an engineering philosophy for the carefree developer.
* **No Syntax Despair**: We replaced the high-contrast neon with soft, "wool" tones. Code should feel comforting, not aggressive.
* **Ink-Bold Logic**: Your code is rendered in **Comic Sans MS** at `font-weight: 800`. Debugging should feel like a craft, not a chore.
* **B&W Sidebar**: The activity bar and sidebar are strictly grayscale to protect my character's aesthetic integrity. No corporate blue icons allowed in the workspace.
* **Anti-Trash-White**: The core editor background is `#f3efe0`, a high-tier ivory, totally free of `#ffffff` pollution.

## 🎨 2. THE TOKEN PALETTE (v3.0)
every single color token has been carefully selected to feel like rich materials.
* **`editor.background`**: `#f3efe0` (The Luxurious Ivory Paper Base)
* **`sideBar.background`**: `#e6e1cf` (The Sturdy Almond Parchment Sidebar)
* **`editorLineNumber.foreground`**: `#d4af37` (The Golden Crochet Hook)
* **`editor.foreground`**: `#3a352f` (The Deep Typewriter Ink)
* **`comment`**: `#a67c52` (The Soft Pink Yarn Comment) - new!
* **`keyword`**: `#3a352f` (The Bold Knit Stitch for Keywords)

## 🛠️ 3. HOW TO APPLY THE HIJACK
it's a simple stitch:
1. **Open github.dev**: Navigate to any repository on GitHub and press the `.` key on your keyboard to open `github.dev`.
2. **Open Settings JSON**: Hit `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac) to open the Command Palette. Type "Open User Settings (JSON)" and select it.
3. **Paste the Snippet**: Copy the entire content of `settings.json` from this repository and paste it into your `settings.json` file, replacing any existing customizations if you want the full experience.
4. **Comic Sans Check**: Ensure your operating system has "Comic Sans MS" installed for the font to render correctly.
5. **Reload & Relax**: Reload the page or the editor. Your workspace is now a cozy crafting haven.
